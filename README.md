# Agent Council

A skill and agent for [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/) that throws three different AI models at your problem in parallel — then either has them **build on each other's ideas** or **debate to stress-test the answer** — before an orchestrator delivers the final result.

Two modes, same foundation:
- **Collaborative** 🤝 (default) — agents explore independently, read each other's work, improve their answers, then an orchestrator writes the best possible synthesis
- **Adversarial** 🗡️ — agents draft independently, the orchestrator picks the strongest position, the others attack it, then a verdict is delivered

Fast enough for daily use on hard problems. Smart enough to **decline the council entirely** when the task is too simple to justify the overhead.

## What's this for?

This is a **[Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/)** extension. You need Copilot CLI installed and running. It won't work with regular GitHub Copilot in your editor — this is the terminal-based agent.

It gives you two things:
- A **skill** that triggers inside any Copilot CLI session (just type `council: your question`)
- A **standalone agent** you can run directly (`copilot --agent AgentCouncil`)

## Why three models?

Ask one model a question and you get one perspective. It'll sound confident even when it's wrong. It won't question its own assumptions. It definitely won't try to break its own argument.

Different models have different blind spots. Claude is good at nuance but might overcomplicate things. GPT might miss edge cases Claude catches. Gemini has strong grounding but different reasoning patterns. By running them all in parallel and then having them interact, you get something no single model can produce alone.

The key insight: **the mode determines how they interact.**
- In collaborative mode, they steal each other's best ideas and the result is a novel synthesis
- In adversarial mode, they attack the strongest position and the result is a battle-tested answer

### The roles

| # | Codename | Collaborative Role | Adversarial Role | Default Model |
|---|----------|--------------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Alpha** | Deep Explorer | Drafter & Red Teamer | `claude-opus-4.6` |
| 2 | **Beta** | Practical Builder | Fact-Checker & Validator | `gpt-5.4` |
| 3 | **Gamma** | Elegant Minimalist | Optimizer & Devil's Advocate | `gemini-3.1-pro` |
| 4 | **Orchestrator** | Author (writes final synthesis) | Judge (delivers verdict) | `claude-opus-4.6` |

The council works best when each seat uses a **different model family**. If one model is unavailable, prefer another unused family; if that is impossible, run a smaller council instead of duplicating a family.

## How it works

### Collaborative Mode 🤝 (Default)

    X --> A2["Alpha improves"] & B2["Beta improves"] & C2["Gamma improves"]
    A2 & B2 & C2 --> D["🌟 Orchestrator writes final synthesis"]
    D --> E["Final answer delivered"]

    style B1 fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style C1 fill:#f39c12,color:#fff
    style A2 fill:#4a90d9,color:#fff

    style C2 fill:#f39c12,color:#fff
    style D fill:#9b59b6,color:#fff
    style E fill:#2ecc71,color:#fff
```

1. **Draft** — Alpha, Beta, and Gamma all explore the problem independently from their angle
2. **Improve** — Each agent reads the other two drafts and writes an improved version, stealing the best ideas
3. **Synthesize** — The orchestrator authors the definitive response from the three improved drafts

### Adversarial Mode 🗡️

```mermaid

    A1["📝 Alpha: thorough draft + self-critique"] & B1["✅ Beta: independent solution + fact-check"] & C1["🔧 Gamma: elegant alternative + devil's advocate"]
    A1 & B1 & C1 --> T{"🎯 Orchestrator triages"}
    T -- "full consensus" --> V
    T -- "leader selected" --> ATK_B["⚔️ Beta attacks leader"]
    T -- "leader selected" --> ATK_C["⚔️ Gamma attacks leader"]
    ATK_B & ATK_C --> V["🏛️ Orchestrator delivers verdict"]
    V --> E["SURVIVED ✅ / MODIFIED 🔄 / OVERTURNED ❌"]

    style A1 fill:#4a90d9,color:#fff
    style B1 fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style C1 fill:#f39c12,color:#fff
    style T fill:#9b59b6,color:#fff

    style ATK_C fill:#c0392b,color:#fff
    style V fill:#9b59b6,color:#fff
    style E fill:#2ecc71,color:#fff
```

1. **Draft** — Alpha, Beta, and Gamma all tackle the problem independently
2. **Triage** — The orchestrator uses a fixed rubric to identify the strongest position. If consensus, skip to verdict.
3. **Attack** — The other two agents try to tear apart the leading position
4. **Verdict** — The orchestrator decides: did the leader survive, need modification, or get overturned?

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/) installed and authenticated
- Access to multiple models through Copilot (the defaults use Claude, GPT, and Gemini)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sentry01/AgentCouncil.git
cd AgentCouncil

# Copy the skill
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/skills/agent-council
cp skills/agent-council/skill.md ~/.copilot/skills/agent-council/skill.md

# Copy the agent
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/agents
cp agents/AgentCouncil.agent.md ~/.copilot/agents/AgentCouncil.agent.md
```

No dependencies. No build. Just markdown files that Copilot CLI reads.

## Usage

### Mode detection

The council automatically detects which mode to use based on your language:

| You say... | Mode | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| `council: How should we structure the API?` | 🤝 Collaborative | Default — exploring a design space |
| `brainstorm: Novel approaches to caching` | 🤝 Collaborative | "brainstorm" = collaborative |
| `debate: Monorepo vs polyrepo` | 🗡️ Adversarial | "debate" = adversarial |
| `stress-test: Is this auth flow secure?` | 🗡️ Adversarial | "stress-test" = adversarial |
| `adversarial council: Should we use GraphQL?` | 🗡️ Adversarial | Explicit override |
| `collaborative council: Best testing strategy` | 🤝 Collaborative | Explicit override |

**Adversarial triggers:** debate, adversarial, challenge, stress-test, which is better, argue, attack, defend, versus, vs

**Collaborative triggers (default):** council, siege, swarm, brainstorm, collaborate, explore, build on, novel, creative, ideas

If both sets of trigger words appear, adversarial wins unless you use an explicit override like `collaborative council: ...`.

### Complexity gate

The council should **short-circuit** and answer directly when the task is too simple to justify 6-7 subagent calls.

Typical fast-path cases:
- arithmetic or obvious factual lookups
- one-line rewrites
- file lookups and command syntax
- narrow questions with one obvious path

Typical council-worthy cases:
- competing designs with real tradeoffs
- security or correctness-sensitive review
- architecture and research synthesis
- ambiguous problems where multi-perspective synthesis can beat one model

### Inside a Copilot CLI session

```
council: Should we use a monorepo or polyrepo for our microservices?
```

```
debate: Redis vs Memcached for our session store — which survives at scale?
```

### As a standalone agent

```bash
copilot --agent AgentCouncil "Brainstorm novel approaches to real-time sync"
```

```bash
copilot --agent AgentCouncil "Stress-test this auth flow for vulnerabilities"
```

### Seeing the internal process

By default you only get the final answer. If you want to see the reasoning flow:

```
verbose council: What caching strategy for a real-time dashboard?
```

**Verbose mode** shows a concise phase-by-phase view:
- 💡 Alpha / 🔨 Beta / ✨ Gamma
- improved drafts or attack summaries
- final synthesis or verdict

If you want every draft in full, ask for **raw** or **full** council output explicitly.

## When to use each mode

### Collaborative 🤝 — when you want novel ideas

- Brainstorming sessions and creative problem-solving
- Exploring a design space with no clear "right answer"
- Building something new where diverse perspectives help
- Research where breadth and synthesis matter

### Adversarial 🗡️ — when you want battle-tested answers

- Architecture decisions you'll live with for years
- Security reviews (missed vulns are expensive)
- Comparing two specific approaches (A vs B)
- Anything where you need confidence the answer holds up under scrutiny

### Not worth it (either mode)

- Quick fixes, file lookups, simple questions
- Anything where speed matters more than correctness
- Your model budget is tight

## Cost & speed

| Mode | Subagent Calls | Parallel Rounds | Wall Clock |
|------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Collaborative | 7 (3 + 3 + orchestrator) | 2 | ~2 rounds + synthesis |
| Adversarial | 6 (3 + 2 + orchestrator) | 2 | ~2 rounds + verdict |

Both modes run agents in parallel within each phase. The wall-clock time is roughly two sequential subagent calls plus the final orchestrator step, regardless of how many agents run in each round.

For trivial tasks, the correct move is to skip the council entirely.

## Adapting to domains

The agents shift focus depending on what you're asking about:

| Domain | Alpha focuses on | Beta focuses on | Gamma focuses on |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Code | Implementation + security self-review | API accuracy, versions, edge cases | Performance, readability, alternatives |
| Architecture | System design + failure modes | Tech claims, benchmarks, scalability | Simplicity, clarity, alternatives |
| Research | Comprehensive analysis + bias check | Source verification, citations | Actionability, counter-arguments |
| Writing | Content + tone self-critique | Factual accuracy, consistency | Flow, conciseness, formatting |

Domain precedence is: **Code → Architecture → Writing → Research → General**.

Here, **Research** means investigation or literature-style evaluation, not code review.

## Example

Here's the council in action — Phase 1 dispatching all three agents in parallel across different model families:

![Council Phase 1 — three agents dispatched in parallel](docs/council-example.png)

## Example prompts

**Collaborative — brainstorming:**
```
council: Novel approaches to real-time collaboration in a document editor.
Think beyond CRDTs and OT.
```

**Collaborative — architecture:**
```
council: Design a notification system that scales to 1M users.
Push, pull, fan-out strategies.
```

**Adversarial — decision:**
```
debate: WebSockets + Redis pub/sub vs SSE + message queue for 10K concurrent users.
Cost, complexity, scaling, failure modes.
```

**Adversarial — security:**
```
verbose stress-test: Review this JWT implementation: [paste code]
```

**Adversarial — comparison:**
```
debate: PostgreSQL vs DynamoDB for a multi-tenant SaaS with unpredictable query patterns
```
